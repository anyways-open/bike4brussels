Meeting 03.07. with Brussels Mobility

=> User friendliness of a printed bycicle map in a mobile website/app

Problems of existing app: 

- limited to cycle routes
- not always very logical for short distances
- extra info on shortcuts, avoiding cobble stones, big slopes
- more than 3km, cycle route will be best
- less than that, using short cuts or bus lane
- exisitng apps (google) propose roads that are not good for cyclists
- main issue last year: scope of the project was too big.


Examples for inspiration:

- bikecitizens best cycling app around. some cities have a contract with them and use their data within the app. 
- example for routeplanner: NRW has been developing a route planning website using info on slopes, hills, 
- ghent/flanders too with info on cobble stones

(Possible) Features:

- website tool is okay
- add possibilities of route planning using marked cycle lanes, bus lanes, one-way streets for cyclists
- have several options: relaxed route (mostly cycling routes) & quickest route (with cycling infrastructure) & quickest route (cycling with cars)
- navigation app is not the most important, information on site is important
- make routes downloadable?
- app would be nice (minister would like it)
- give cyclists a tool that is the most useful for them
- launch event
- multilingual: dutch, french, english
- where do i cycle? how to get from a to b?
- make routes shareable: send routes
- grades for quickness, comfort, traffic lights (speed), distance, safety score
- waze like crowdsourced info
- give an overview of queries to brussels mobility. visual representation (glow map) which routes are queried the most. which are the routes people want to cycle on? 

Design: 

- design perspective: add info to current website. how to explain the routes to people? how to reflect cycle lane vs. bike network. follow sign posting or normal road?
- bike for brussels graphical guidelines on website

Promotion:

- work with agency to promote the app.


To do:

- document with all criteria with priorities for cyclists
- prepare questions for thursday (1 pm)
