# Bike for Brussels Route Planner

Popular routeplanner apps often do not consider bike-friendly routes and therefore are not optimal to use when cycling in the city. We are building a routeplanning app for bikers in Brussels that will consider cycling infrastructure, road quality, slope and other criteria to provide the best route to get to where you want to go.
